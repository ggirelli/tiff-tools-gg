### `tiff_split.m`

`tiff_split.m` can be run on MATLAB as `tiff_split(filename, outfolder, small_side)`, and it splits the `filename` tiff image in smaller square tiff images of side `small_side` saving them in the `outfolder` folder. Use `help tiff_split` or `doc tiff_split` for more details.

### Conversion

Conversion tools are available in the [conversion](conversion/) folder.
